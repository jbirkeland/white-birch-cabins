      <h2>Guest Testimonials</h2>
      
      <div class="guest-quote"><blockquote>"I just returned from a stay at White Birch and I had a great time. The resort is family oriented and our two children, ages 8 and 10, really enjoyed themselves. We fished, played in the sand, swam, played horseshoes, explored Blackduck and some of the local attractions and made lots and lots of S'Mores! Monte and Sandy were always available to answer any questions and make suggestions on fishing spots and good restaurants."</blockquote><b>Jason P.</b></div>

      <div class="guest-quote"><blockquote>"This was our third visit and we had another wonderful time.  Thank so much for everything!"</blockquote><b>Lee and Ann S.</b></div>

      <div class="guest-quote"><blockquote>"Your facilities are wonderful!  Thank you for such a wonderful stay!"</blockquote><b>Jon P. Family</b></div>

      <div class="guest-quote"><blockquote>"We loved our trip last summer!  This cabin#4 is beautiful!"</blockquote><b>Kim R.</b></div>

      <div class="guest-quote"><blockquote>"We really loved it!  It was an enjoyable mix of antique and new all in one. It was so well stocked - popcorn and everything from strainer, baking dishes to ice cream scoop were readily available.  It was so spacious and beautifully decorated.  We looked at what the cabins use to look like before you rebuilt and WOW you have done a lot!  I think I could quit my day job and hang out for the summer.  The kids are wanting to make it a yearly tradition.  I've already asked a biking friend and his family to come next time and we will go biking on all the biking trails in Bemidji.  Yes, I will definitely recommend this place to anyone. I have already done that. See you next summer."</blockquote><b>Todd M.</b></div>

      <div class="guest-quote"><blockquote>"WOW your accommodations. You have outdone yourself with each home you build. We will be back again next year."</blockquote><b>Darrel</b></div>
